## Integration Tests

### Fuel Purchase Auto-Import
The `import-verified-fuel-transactions` edge function now:
- Creates expense_transactions from verified fuel purchases
- Sets expense_type = 'fuel_purchase'
- Marks as payment_status = 'paid' (pre-paid)
- Auto-approves verified transactions
- Flags questionable transactions for review
- Links to fuel_statement_id
- Updates odometer readings for fleet vehicles

### Credit Card Integration
- Credit card transactions can be linked via credit_card_id
- Bidirectional references maintained
- Receipt requirements enforced
- Employee tracking included

## Migration Strategy

The migration script (`migrations/migrate_to_unified_expenses.sql`) consolidates:

1. **Vendor Invoices** (from transactions table)
   - Maps status to payment_status
   - Determines approval_status based on amount and status
   - Preserves receipt URLs and payment confirmations
   - Maintains vendor relationships

2. **Fuel Transactions** (from fuel_transactions_new)
   - Auto-categorizes as fuel_purchase
   - Sets payment_status = 'paid' (pre-paid via WEX)
   - Flags unverified transactions for review
   - Links vehicle and driver data

3. **Credit Card Purchases** (from credit_card_transactions)
   - Enforces receipt requirements
   - Links to employees and cards
   - Categorizes by existing category_id
   - Tracks receipt upload status

### Migration Safety Features
- Prevents duplicates with NOT EXISTS checks
- Preserves all timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Maps old statuses to new approval workflow
- Creates performance indexes
- Includes verification queries
- Flags missing receipts automatically

### Post-Migration Verification
```sql
-- Verify record counts
SELECT 
  expense_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN has_receipt = true THEN 1 END) as with_receipts,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN approval_status = 'pending_review' THEN 1 END) as needs_review
FROM expense_transactions
GROUP BY expense_type;

-- Check for missing required receipts
SELECT COUNT(*) as missing_receipts
FROM expense_transactions
WHERE receipt_required = true 
AND has_receipt = false;
```
